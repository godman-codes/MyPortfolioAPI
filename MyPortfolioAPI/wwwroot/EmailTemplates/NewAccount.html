<!-- Explanation:

I've added a style attribute to the div element to set the background color to a light blue (#f0f5ff) and added some padding to create spacing between the content and the container.
I've also added inline styles to each paragraph (p) element to customize the font size, color, and margins.
The color property is used to set the text color for the content. The #000 value represents black, and the #007bff value represents a bright blue color.
The b element is used to make the Username and Password labels bold, and I've used a span element to wrap the placeholders ([[EmailAddress]] and [[NewPassword]]) for the login details. The span elements are colored with the blue (#007bff) color to make them stand out.
Please note that email clients have varying levels of support for CSS, and some may strip or ignore certain CSS properties. To ensure the best possible display across different email clients, it's best to test your customized email template in multiple email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) and make any necessary adjustments. Additionally, consider inline CSS as opposed to external stylesheets to increase compatibility.
